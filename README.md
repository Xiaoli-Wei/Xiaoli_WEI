### About me  
Currently I am an assistant professor at Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute.  I was a post-doc at University of California, Berkeley under the supervision of Professor Xin Guo. Previously I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Université Paris Diderot under the supervision of Professor Huyên Pham in 2018.

### Research  
My research interests lie in stochastic controls and stochastic differential games and their applications to financial mathematics. I also have developed interests in the interface of machine learning with stochastic controls, stochastic differential games, and financial mathematics.
